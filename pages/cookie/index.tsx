        Cookies can be "Persistent" or "Session" Cookies. Persistent Cookies
        remain on your personal computer or mobile device when You go offline,
        while Session Cookies are deleted as soon as You close your web browser.

        We may use both session and persistent Cookies for the purposes set out
        below:
      </p>

      <div style={{ marginLeft: "50px" }}>
        <h4>Strictly Necessary / Essential Cookies</h4>
        <p>Type: Session Cookies</p>
        <p>
          Purpose: These Cookies are essential to provide You with services
          available through the Website and to enable You to use some of its
          features. They help to authenticate users and prevent fraudulent use
          of user accounts. Without these Cookies, the services that You have
          asked for cannot be provided, and We only use these Cookies to provide
          You with those services.

          Purpose: These Cookies allow us to remember choices You make when You
          use the Website, such as remembering your login details or language
          preference. The purpose of these Cookies is to provide You with a more
          personal experience and to avoid You having to re-enter your
          preferences every time You use the Website.

          the Website and how users use the Website. The information gathered
          via these Cookies may directly or indirectly identify you as an
          individual visitor. This is because the information collected is
          typically linked to a pseudonymous identifier associated with the
          device you use to access the Website. We may also use these Cookies to
          test new advertisements, pages, features or new functionality of the

          advertising which is more likely to be of interest to You. These
          Cookies use information about your browsing history to group You with
          other users who have similar interests. Based on that information, and
          with Our permission, third party advertisers can place Cookies to
          enable them to show adverts which We think will be relevant to your
          interests while You are on third party websites
